# About S.O.P.H.I.E.
st.markdown("""
    ## Features of S.O.P.H.I.E.

    ### 1. **Fault Detection System**
    The **Fault Detection System** is a powerful tool designed to identify abnormalities in mechanical and industrial systems. It leverages machine learning algorithms, specifically **Isolation Forests**, to detect faults in complex systems. By identifying deviations from normal behavior, this system helps prevent costly downtime, improve safety, and optimize operations.

    **How It Works**: This system is based on anomaly detection techniques, where the model is trained using data from operational systems. The model then learns to identify the patterns of normal operation and flags any data points that diverge from these patterns as potential faults. This capability makes it invaluable for industries like manufacturing, transportation, and energy.
    
    ### 2. **Micro-Doppler based Target Classification System**
    The **Micro-Doppler based Target Classification System** uses advanced radar signal processing techniques to classify moving objects based on their Doppler shifts. This system is ideal for military and surveillance applications where distinguishing between various types of moving targets (e.g., vehicles, drones) is critical.

    **How It Works**: By analyzing the Doppler shifts in radar signals, this system can classify targets based on their motion characteristics. The classification model is powered by machine learning algorithms that learn patterns associated with different types of targets. Once trained, it can identify and classify incoming objects in real-time, providing invaluable data for military and security operations.

    ### 3. **Military Vehicles Detection System**
    The **Military Vehicles Detection System** is designed to automatically detect and classify military vehicles in satellite imagery or video feeds. This is crucial for defense and security agencies to monitor and track enemy movements in real-time.

    **How It Works**: Using deep learning-based object detection models like **YOLO** or **Faster R-CNN**, the system analyzes visual data and detects military vehicles. The system is trained with large datasets of vehicle images to identify vehicles even under challenging conditions. It can process images quickly, making it suitable for real-time surveillance.

    ### 4. **Two-Way Signal Processing (Secure Two-Way Data Link)**
    The **Two-Way Signal Processing** system ensures secure, encrypted communication between two endpoints, making it essential in applications requiring data security and integrity, such as military communications and secure business transactions.

    **How It Works**: The system uses advanced encryption techniques to secure data transmission between two parties. Through symmetric encryption (AES) and public key infrastructure (RSA), data is encrypted and authenticated before transmission. The system ensures uninterrupted communication by handling network issues such as packet loss and jitter.
